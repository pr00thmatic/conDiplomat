con Diplomat is an in-development game for the Oculus Quest (no, we haven't yet pitched it to Oculus... we will do... soon...)

This is basically what this game is about:

You have been a *con seller* all your life, you earn your daily bread by rippingi off others with your exceptional social engineering habilities... but things will change after you have a breakfast with your son, he makes you wanna change! so he helps you to get a job interview... and just when you think you will be able to earn some coins on an honorable way, you stumble across the most corrupt minister of foreign affairs! he wanna hire you to make his job as he practices his golf habilities... you know! it's really important that he can play golf... national security issue!

So... will you be able to achieve world peace? or your lack of manners will condemn your country and the world?
