=): *looks at the paperwork*
    what is that?
    is it job related? can I see it?
    you are an amazing salesman!
    and I wanna learn from the very best!

>=(: *looks at the paperwork*
     is that paperwork?
     I see you are working in sales back again...
     can I see it?

you handover the paperwork. [mad--]

> *reads through it*
=):  *happy* *weird* *sad*
     so you are still a con artist...
     *scofs*
     I see where sissy got her dark side,
     after all, apples don't fall far from the three...

     but... swindling an old lady? even 8 year old sissy knows better


>=(: *neutral* *weird* *mad*
     are you really going to sell nonsense to an old lady?
     what is wrong with you?
     that's why mom left you!

you don't hang it over [mad++]
=): c'mon dad! I promise I won't laugh...
    wait... you don't wanna share?
    or could it be... *looks at you*
    no! you are working as a con-artist again, aren't you?!
    dad! I thought we talked you out of this the last time
    you made us a promise!...
    well... I guess... nobody can trust you, after all.

>=(: *mad* *silence*
     what? you don't wanna show?
     why would that be? I think I know WHY is that...
     you are working as a con-artist again! aren't you?!
     what is wrong with you?!
     that's why mom left you!
     the last time we met, you promised us you wouldn't do this again!
     how stupid we were... you are a con-artist, that's what con-artists do, they lie!

     <no gift>
     you know what?
     I know you forgot my b-day again, but still! you brought me the best gift ever!
     PERSPECTIVE... now I know you'll never change... good bye dad!
